# About

The goal of this project was to create a coin washing machine using verilog on an FPGA board.
By utilizing the buttons, switches and seven segment displays on the FPGA board
users have the ablity to select between basic wash, normal wash and deluxe wash.


# Notes
- Run using Xilinx ISE and Spartan 3E FPGA board
- National Instruments Functioin Generator was used to program clock
- FSM contains Finite state diagrams for how washing machine should function
- ASM contains algorithmic state machine diagram for washing machine function
